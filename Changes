Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::libiptc.

0.06  Fri Jun 13 17:13:21 CEST 2008
	- Matthew "Cheetah" Gabeler-Lee <cheetah(at)fastcat.org>:
		Make it compile even if iptables libiptc is not on the
		system, by linking with local library object libiptc in
		library_iptc/libiptc.a.

	- libiptc: Integrated scalability fixes. Most of which has
	  been accepted upstream in 1.4.1.  Most significant
	  scalability fix is for chain name searching, used in
	  function is_chain() and iptables_do_command().

	- The local libiptc has been keept up-to-date with iptables
	  1.4.0. But the iptables.c command interface is still from 1.3.4.

	- iptables-blocking: Add an iptables command that does uses a
	  simple file lock. Can be used to replace the iptables
	  command to avoid race conditions between two iptables commands.


0.05  Tue Nov 20 12:47:11 2007
	- Bugfix: Include all files in tarball by updating MANIFEST.
	  Version 0.04 could not compile, because the tarball did not
	  contain all the relevant files (ups, didn't keep MANIFEST in
	  sync).

0.04  Thu Nov 15 16:01:16 2007
	- First CPAN release.
	  Primarily documentation updates.

0.03  Thu Jul 13 16:24:07 2006
	- Because libiptc.c contained some bugs, it has been
          necessary to include it the module and compile libiptc.a our
          self.  The module still depends on the iptables extensions
          being available on the system.

0.02  Tue Jul 4 13:17:16 2006
	- First initial working version.

0.01  Thu Jun 22 14:01:55 2006
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-n IPTables::libiptc include/libiptc/libiptc.h
